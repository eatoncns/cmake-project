# cmake-project
CMake based C++ project template intended to bootstrap new project setup.

Gmock/gtest will be downloaded as part of configuration step and built as external project.

My development environment is typically CLion on macOS, xubuntu or windows (cygwin toolchain). I haven't tested outside of that currently.
